== Introduction

The Anypoint Connector for the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) is used as a bi-directional gateway between Mule applications and HDFS.

Read through this user guide to understand how to set up and configure a basic flow using the connector. Track feature additions, compatibility, limitations and API version updates with each release of the connector using the link:/release-notes/hdfs-connector-release-notes[Connector Release Notes]. Review the connector operations and functionality using the link:/mulesoft.github.io/hdfs-connector[Technical Reference] alongside the link:https://www.mulesoft.com/exchange#!/?filters=HDFS&sortBy=rank[demo applications].

== Prerequisites

This document assumes that you are familiar with Mule.

To use the HDFS connector, you need:

* *Anypoint Studio* version 7.0 or above - An instance of link:https://www.mulesoft.com/lp/dl/mule-esb-enterprise[Anypoint Studio]. If you do not use Anypoint Studio for development, follow the instructions in <<Configuring Maven Dependencies,Configuring Maven Dependencies>> for your project.
* An instance of Hadoop Distributed File System  up and running. It can be downloaded from link:http://hadoop.apache.org/releases.html[here].

== Compatibility

HDFS Hadoop connector is compatible with the following:

[%header,width="100%",cols="50%,50%"]
|===
|Application/Service|Version
|Mule Runtime |4.0 or newer
|Apache Hadoop |2.8.1 or newer
|===

== Install the Connector

You can install a connector in Anypoint Studio following the instructions from link: https://beta-mule-sdk.docs-stgx.mulesoft.com/connectors/common-add-module-task [To Add a Connector to Studio].

=== Upgrading from an Older Version

If you’re currently using an older version of the connector, a small popup appears in the bottom right corner of Anypoint Studio with an "Updates Available" message.

. Click the popup and check for available updates. 
. Click the Connector version checkbox and click *Next* and follow the instructions provided by the user interface. 
. *Restart* Studio when prompted. 
. After restarting, when creating a flow and using the HDFS Connector, if you have several versions of the connector installed, you may be asked which version you would like to use. Choose the version you would like to use.

Additionally, we recommend that you keep Studio up to date with its latest version.

== Configure the Connector Global Element

To use the HDFS connector in your Mule application, you must configure a global HDFS element that can be used by the connector (read more about  link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.8/global-elements[Global Elements]). The HDFS connector offers the following global configuration options, requiring the following credentials:

=== Simple Authentication Configuration

[%header,width="100a",cols="50a,50a"]
|===
|Field |Description
|*NameNode URI* |The URI of the file system to connect to.
[NOTE]
This is passed to the HDFS client as the *FileSystem#FS_DEFAULT_NAME_KEY* configuration entry. It can be overridden by values in configurationResources and configurationEntries.
|*Username* | User identity that Hadoop uses for permissions in HDFS.
[NOTE]
When Simple Authentication is used, Hadoop requires the user to be set as a System Property called HADOOP_USER_NAME. If you fill this field then the connector will set it for you, however you can set it by yourself. If the variable is not set, Hadoop will use the current logged in OS user.
|*Configuration Resources* |A list of configuration resource files to be loaded by the HDFS client. Here you can provide additional configuration files. (e.g core-site.xml)
|*Configuration Entries* |A map of configuration entries to be used by the HDFS client. Here you can provide additional configuration entries as key/value pairs.
|===

=== Kerberos Authentication Configuration

[%header,width="100a",cols="50a,50a"]
|===
|Field |Description
|*NameNode URI* |The URI of the file system to connect to.
[NOTE]
This is passed to HDFS client as the *FileSystem#FS_DEFAULT_NAME_KEY* configuration entry. It can be overridden by values in configurationResources and configurationEntries.
|*Username* | Kerberos principal.
[NOTE]
This is passed to HDFS client as the "hadoop.job.ugi" configuration entry. It can be overridden by values in configurationResources and configurationEntries. If not provided it will use the currently logged in user.
|*KeytabPath* |Path to the link:https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.12/doc/basic/keytab_def.html[keytab file] associated with username.
[NOTE]
KeytabPath is used in order to obtain TGT from "Authorization server".  If not provided it will look for a TGT associated to username within your local kerberos cache.
|*Configuration Resources* |A list of configuration resource files to be loaded by the HDFS client. Here you can provide additional configuration files. (e.g core-site.xml)
|*Configuration Entries* |A map of configuration entries to be used by the HDFS client. Here you can provide additional configuration entries as key/value pairs.
|===

== Using the Connector

You can use this connector as an inbound endpoint for polling content of a file at a configurable rate (interval) or as an outbound connector for manipulating data into the HDFS server.

[NOTE]
See a full list of operations for any version of the connector link:/mulesoft.github.io/hdfs-connector[here].

=== Connector Namespace and Schema

When designing your application in Studio, the act of dragging the connector from the palette onto the Anypoint Studio canvas should automatically populate the XML code with the connector *namespace* and *schema location*.

*Namespace:* `http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/hdfs` +
*Schema Location:* `http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/connector/current/mule-hdfs.xsd`

[TIP]
If you are manually coding the Mule application in Studio's XML editor or other text editor, define the namespace and schema location in the header of your *Configuration XML*, inside the `<mule>` tag.

== Demo Mule Application Using Connector

Existing demos demonstrate how to use the connector for link:http://mulesoft.github.io/hdfs-connector/[basic file system operations] and how to link:http://mulesoft.github.io/hdfs-connector/[poll data from a file] at a specific interval.

=== Example Use Case

The following example shows how to create a text file into HDFS using the connector:

. In Anypoint Studio, click *File* > *New* > *Mule Project*, name the project, and click *OK*.
. In the search field, type "http" and drag the *HTTP* connector to the canvas, click the green plus sign to the right of *Connector Configuration*, and in the next screen, click *OK* to accept the default settings. Name the endpoint */createFile*.
. In the Search bar type "HDFS" and drag the *HDFS* connector onto the canvas. Configure as explained <<Configure the Connector Global Element>>
. Choose *Write to path* as an operation. Set *Path* to `/test.txt` (this is the path of the file that is going to be created into HDFS) and leave other options with default values.
. The flow should look like this:
+
image:create-file-flow.png[Create file flow]
+
. Run the application. From your favorite HTTP client make a POST request with "Content-type:plain/text" to `locahost:8081/createFile` with content that you want to write as payload. (e.g. `curl -X POST -H "Content-Type:plain/text" -d "payload to write to file" localhost:8090/createFile`)
. Check that */test.txt* has been created and has your content by using Hadoop explorer.
* A demo with the above mentioned use case was provided.
